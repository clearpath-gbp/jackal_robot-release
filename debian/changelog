ros-melodic-jackal-bringup (0.6.3-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #37 <https://github.com/jackal/jackal_robot/issues/37> from luis-camero/melodic-devel
    Added Velodyne HDL-32E driver launch file to the accessories launch
  * Added Velodyne HDL-32E driver launch file to the accessories launch file under environment variable JACKAL_LASER_3D_MODEL=hdl32e
  * Add envar support for adding a GX5 family IMU (#34 <https://github.com/jackal/jackal_robot/issues/34>)
    * Launch the GX5 IMU node if necessary
    * Change the name of the frame id arg for the IMU to match with the latest ros_mscl
    * Use the ENU frame instead of NED for the GX5
  * Merge pull request #32 <https://github.com/jackal/jackal_robot/issues/32> from jackal/rsci-227
    Set fender lidar angle range
  * Set the max/min angles for the fender lidars to [-pi, pi] to prevent the sensors from seeing the wheels/chassis.  If the robot sees its own wheels it can cause problems with ARK, which is the main use-case for the fender lasers.
  * 0.6.2
  * Update the changelogs ahead of release
  * Fix the name of the VLP16 launch file that gets included in accessories
  * Fix a c&p error where and arg was referenced before it was actually assigned
  * Contributors: Chris I-B, Chris Iverach-Brereton, Luis Camero, Tony Baltovski
